## deletion-request

This is a built-in ping that is assembled out of the box by the Glean SDK.

See the Glean SDK documentation for the [`deletion-request` ping](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/deletion-request.html).

All Glean pings contain built-in metrics in the [`ping_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-ping_info-section) and [`client_info`](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/pings/index.html#the-client_info-section) sections.

In addition to those built-in metrics, the following metrics are added to the ping:

| Name | Type | Description | Data reviews | Extras | Expiration | [Data Sensitivity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rally.id |[uuid](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/user/metrics/uuid.html) |The id of the Rally client. This is generated by the Rally SDKs. A value of 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 indicates a test payload. A value of 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111 indicates that the Rally id was not found or properly set.  |[Review 1](TODO)||never | |
